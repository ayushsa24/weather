# 🌦️ Weather Web App

**Weather Web App** is a responsive and interactive weather forecasting website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It leverages the **OpenWeather API** to provide real-time weather updates for any city entered by the user. The application displays essential weather details such as temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility. With a clean and mobile-friendly interface, users can quickly check live weather conditions with a visually appealing layout and dynamic icons that reflect the current weather.

This project was designed to improve my skills in working with RESTful APIs, managing asynchronous data using JavaScript’s `fetch` method, and dynamically updating the DOM. It also involved error handling, validating user input, and creating a user experience that is both informative and easy to navigate.

The current version focuses on delivering accurate, real-time data with smooth performance. Future updates will include enhancements like geolocation-based weather detection, hourly and weekly forecasts, dark/light mode toggle, and UI improvements to enrich the overall user experience.

Whether you're checking the weather before planning your day or exploring how to build a live-data web application, this project demonstrates how a beginner-friendly tech stack can be used to create useful and modern tools. It’s open-source and free to use, modify, or contribute to.
